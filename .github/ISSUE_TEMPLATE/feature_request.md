**System information**
- TensorFlow version (you are using):
- Are you willing to contribute it (Yes/No):

**Motivation**
What use case are you trying to achieve and how may this be relevant to people
broadly?

The clearer the benefit is to the community, the higher the chance that the feature
will be prioritized and added (given maintenance considerations).

As examples:

1. Instead of "Enable the technique for my model", "Enable this technique to
   work better with standard object detection models, including R-CNN (link) and SSD (link)" is stronger.

2. Instead of: "Try something more customized with the technique", "Implement
   a variant of the algorithm described in equations X and Y of this paper" is
   clearer.

**Describe the feature**
Description:

How it helps achieve the use case:

**Describe what you tried to achieve the use case (optional)**

As examples:

1. You tried using APIs X and Y and were able to do Z. However, that was not
   sufficient because of ...

2. You achieved your use case with the code snippet W. However, this was more
   difficult than it should be because of ... (e.g. ran into issue X or had
   to do Y).
